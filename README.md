# Boozy-Tunes!

## Introduction

Welcome to Boozy-Tunes, the worlds leading Cocktail / Music-Playlist generator! Once the user enters our virtual "Bar-cade" they are presented with our patented "boozyTunes, Game-Child" generators; one titled "Pick Your Poison" to create a cocktail generated with their liquor of choice, the other titled "Pick Your Vibe" generates a unique playlist to perfectly pair a musical vibe with the users drink of choice! Still undecided...worry not, our "final-boss" generator located at the bottom of our screen will generate both a random "Poison" and "Vibe".

## User Story

In these uncertain times, there is ONE thing that will always be certain… Booze and Tunes. Name a better duo, I’ll wait ;-)... As a user, I want to find a new cocktail recipe and a vibey playlist to go along with it. I want to be able to select a specific ingredient (type of alcohol) that will be in my cocktail, and also be able to choose a specific genre for my playlist. After I select my options, a result will generate next to the search containing a thumbnail and cocktail recipe, as well as an embedded playlist. HOWEVER… sometimes I don’t like to think BUT, I do like to party. Soooo, I also want the option of randomizing (curating a vibe) my cocktail choice and playlist.
